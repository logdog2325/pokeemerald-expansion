# Draconid Emerald – design decisions

Every open choice made without asking, so it can be overruled later.
Format: **decision** – alternatives considered – why. Newest feedback always wins;
when a playtest note overrides something here, the entry is updated and marked.

## Project / tooling

- **D-001 Base version**: pokeemerald-expansion 1.17.1 (`master` @ dfb0f843), working branch `draconid-emerald`.
  – Alt: `upcoming`. – `master` is the stable, released line; fewer surprises while building a whole game.
- **D-002 Toolchain**: Ubuntu's `gcc-arm-none-eabi` 13.2 instead of devkitARM.
  – Alt: devkitARM. – INSTALL.md's documented Ubuntu path; no extra downloads; `make` + `make check` pass.
- **D-003 Poryscript output is committed**: `*.pory` → `*.inc` via `poryscript_rules.mk`; the generated `.inc` is committed.
  – Alt: gitignore the `.inc` and require Poryscript for every build. – The ROM still builds on a machine
  without Poryscript; the rule refuses to build if a `.pory` is newer than its `.inc` and the tool is missing,
  so stale scripts can't slip through. Line markers are off (`-lm=false`) to keep the committed files clean.
- **D-004 Porytiles 2.0 from source with clang + libc++**: GCC < 15's libstdc++ lacks C++23
  `vector::append_range`, used 142× in Porytiles 2.0. Built with clang 18 + libc++ 18.
  The binary is not committed (`tools/hack/install_tools.sh --porytiles` rebuilds it).
  – Alt: legacy Porytiles 0.x (`porytiles-legacy`). – 2.0 is current and supports expansion directly.
- **D-005 Debug menu**: kept the expansion default `DEBUG_OVERWORLD_MENU = DISABLED_ON_RELEASE`
  (on for `make`, off for `make release`). Open it with **R + Start** in the overworld.
  – Alt: start-menu entry (`DEBUG_OVERWORLD_IN_MENU`). – Default key combo doesn't change the start menu.
- **D-006 Porymap config**: `porymap.*.cfg` stay gitignored (per-user). `tools/hack/porymap_scripts/register.py`
  writes `custom_scripts` into `porymap.user.cfg` and `use_poryscript=1` into `porymap.project.cfg`.

## Megas

- **D-010 All required Megas already exist in 1.17.1**: Charizard-Mega-X, Sceptile, Blaziken, Altaria,
  Salamence, Gallade, Gardevoir and **Feraligatr-Mega (Legends: Z-A, `SPECIES_FERALIGATR_MEGA` = 1529)**.
  No Mega data had to be added; Hydreigon, Dragapult and Kommo-o have no Megas in the expansion and none were
  invented. (Data source: the expansion's own species data.)

## World

- **D-020 Village tilesets**: General + Fallarbor (brown cliffs, waterfalls, rustic houses, pines – the
  Route 114 / Fallarbor look). – Alt: General + Lavaridge (hot springs), General + Fortree. – Best "mountain
  village" feel with existing art; custom Porytiles tiles (shrine, statues, meteorites) come on top later.
